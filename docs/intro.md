## Product Manager of Developer Portals
I've been the product manager of the developer portals for the companies Stream inc and Elavon. During my tenure, I worked alongside designers, developers, and technical writers to create a developer experience that maximized the value of the company's APIs.

## Recent Solo Work

### Game score API
As part of school work, I had to put together an API that could track the scores players got in web games. I took a design first approach and wrote the API documentation before writing the code. You can read the Open API reference docs under the API tab of this site.

### Simplest API Ever
As part of recent computer science classwork, I put together the absolute simplest possible API using express and made a tutorial of the process.
